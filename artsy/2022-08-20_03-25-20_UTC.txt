For many years, native New Yorker Dylan Abruscato (@dylanabruscato) felt alienated by the prospect of art collecting. He’s a millennial who loves art, but he feared that he lacked the deep art world connections he’d need to build a fine art collection. A major transition led Abruscato to reevaluate his priorities. “When my wife and I moved into our first apartment together, I became obsessed with this idea of starting a collection together and filling those walls with art,” he told Artsy. His grandparents shared a mutual love of collecting (prints, in particular), and Abruscato and his wife, Sarah, wanted to follow in their footsteps as they established themselves in their new Brooklyn home. Dylan, who works in partnerships and marketing, learned to translate his professional values to his emerging collecting practice: He makes genuine connections with young artists, purchasing their works and supporting their early careers.⁠
