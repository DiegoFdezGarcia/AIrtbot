With bright, energetic brushstrokes, Chase Hall examines how Blackness has been flattened and fetishized in American culture. In a practice that spans painting, drawing, photography, video, and sculpture, the Minnesota-born artist has made works that range from striking portraits on raw cotton canvas (a nod to the material’s racialized history) to searching videos that capture Black grief, joy, and community.⁠
