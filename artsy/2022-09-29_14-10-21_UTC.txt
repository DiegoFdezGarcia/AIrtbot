It is during the night that Sarah Lee paints views of its secret life from the viewpoint of an unknown observer. So quiet and hidden these scenes are it’s hard to imagine the eyes gazing through the trees and into the sky are hers, or ours. The observing entity is so anonymous and so mysterious it could be the night itself, caught in a moment of self-reflection that through supernatural means has been shared with us through the channeling medium of the artist.⁠
