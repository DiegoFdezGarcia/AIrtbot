From the tip of his graphite pencil, Russell Banx revisits the halcyon as well as the bleak memories of his life, which he patiently shapes on the paper’s surface. Drawn from the far corners of his memory, these recollections seem accessible but distant. Emerging from the darkness or hiding in plain sight, the depicted scenes blur the line between the mundane and the disquieting. They glimpse at moments of loneliness, where imagination becomes vivid.⁠
