Anthony Olubunmi Akinbola uses objects that are culturally significant to Black communities to explore currents that run throughout the lives of some of his Black subjects. He is known for his wall-mounted pieces composed of dozens of colorful durags. For Akinbola, a first-generation Nigerian American, these commodities speak to the challenges of reconciling divisions within Black cultures. While his readymades are symbols of pride, they also reflect on the fetishization of Black culture.⁠
