In vibrant, sorbet-colored landscapes, the self-taught painter Camilla Engström creates paeans to ecological empowerment and rebels against female beauty standards. Land and female forms combine in Engström’s compositions, evoking the canvases of Georgia O’Keeffe, whom the younger artist counts as her number-one inspiration.⁠
