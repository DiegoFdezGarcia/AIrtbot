Known for combining photography, painting, and sculpture, Sam Falls explores the intersection of color, digital imagery, and natural processes. His painted photographic prints raise questions about perception and how we relate to various media. “My images are not only investigating the medium’s potential as an art form, but also continue exploring photography’s capacity for representation and challenging its veracity,” Falls explains.⁠
