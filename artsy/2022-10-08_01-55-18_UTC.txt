During her time at the CloverMill Artist Residency this past spring, Amy Beager stayed in a converted watermill in the remote Dutch countryside, surrounded by flocks of swans. The image of these elegant creatures living and nesting strengthened the artist’s existing interest in the winged animal. Once back in her studio in England, Beager started researching the symbolism behind these white birds more deeply. Beager was particularly drawn to the tale of the Swan Maiden, in which a mythical creature, able to shapeshift between human and swan forms, is forced to marry a young man who stole her feather garment while she was bathing. This story is the main inspiration for Beager’s latest solo exhibition and first with Kristin Hjellegjerde Gallery in London, “Swan Maidens.” The paintings, on view through October 29th, depict sumptuous female and swan forms, often closely intertwined or entangled. With loose, sweeping brushstrokes and a color palette of bright pinks, purples, greens, and reds, Beager creates the impression of a dreamlike, mythical universe.⁠
