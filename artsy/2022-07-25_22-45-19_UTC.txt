Having collected NFTs since late 2017, Jason Bailey—perhaps better known by his Twitter handle, Artnome—has seen his share of ups and downs. He was the first person to buy from the platform SuperRare, as well as the first to buy an NFT by XCOPY, an artist whose 2018 NFT "A Coin For the Ferryman" resold for $6 million on SuperRare in November of last year. In March 2021, Bailey—easily recognizable to those in the crypto world thanks to his signature headband, long hair, and beard—founded ClubNFT, a company that aims to address gaps in the NFT space by offering a free service to back up NFTs; starting an online magazine for critical dialogue, "Right Click Save;" and creating a tool to search artists across sales platforms. At the link in our bio, Bailey shares four key ways collectors can safeguard their NFTs—not only from platforms that might go out of business, but also from phishers and other scammers.⁠
