Tyrrell Winston is known for his assemblages of old basketballs that he frequently arranges into grids so they become studies of material, culture, and history. Self-taught, Winston began his art practice creating collages using paper scraps he found while roaming the streets of New York City, where he had moved to study arts administration at Staten Island’s Wagner College. He also collected debris like basketballs and cigarette butts, which now serve as foundational material for his mixed-media works. Winston, who has built a large following on social media, also creates freestanding sculptures, wall hangings from recycled basketball nets, and paintings of famous athletes’ signatures. His artworks all explore what the artist calls “embedded history”: the narratives perpetually lodged in other people’s discarded objects.⁠
