Julie Curtiss makes unsettling paintings of intricate hairstyles and starkly framed or severed body parts. They undermine stereotypes of femininity, from tamed domesticity to animal freedom. Working in the loosely defined style of Neo-Surrealism, the French-born, Brooklyn-based artist uses her uncanny compositions to challenge standards of beauty.⁠
