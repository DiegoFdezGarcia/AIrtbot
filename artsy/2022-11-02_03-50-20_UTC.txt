Set in placid interiors, Danielle Mckinney’s paintings feature Black women stealing moments of quietude and interiority that solicit a similar stillness from viewers as we slip into the shadows of the canvas. The Atlanta-born, New York–based artist paints with the hopes of “creating a new tone for Black women to exist in places of beauty and rest,” as she described in an interview with Artsy. Her latest meditation is in “Golden Hour,” on view through November 12th at Marianne Boesky Gallery in New York. The solo exhibition takes its title from the time of day right before dusk, a period Mckinney associates with introspection.⁠
