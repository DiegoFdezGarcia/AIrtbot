The carnivalesque images of Chilean Peruvian painter Ivana de Vivanco are tinged with both humor and darkness. The imagined scenes are grounded in the contemporary but they have the stillness and posed quality that characterizes much classical painting. De Vivanco is interested in the aesthetics of Latin American Baroque, which she has characterized as “probably the most colorful and painful Baroque of all since the wound of colonization has remained inscribed in it.” With the saturated color palette of an ’80s workout video, her paintings seamlessly blend clownish antics with a sense of historical weight.⁠
