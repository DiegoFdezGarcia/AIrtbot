In parallel with Paris+ par Art Basel, Nara Roesler (@galerianararoesler) presents a solo exhibition of works by the acclaimed Brazilian artist Lucia Koch. Titled “Double Trouble,” the monumental in-situ project is spread over 1,200+ square feet. Gigantic colored and translucent vellums animated by air currents and the passage of spectators provides a rich sensory experience. Explore the show on Artsy through the link in our bio until October 28th.⁠
