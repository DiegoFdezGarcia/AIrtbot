Deliberately disregarding the momentous in favor of the small and ordinary, Hanna Brody examines the trivial repetitive moments that over time form and define a relationship. Brody utilizes the act of portraiture as a means of reflection, often contemplating her own role in relativity to her formed connections. Vulnerability and sentimentality permeate the works, each intimate portrait exposing Brody’s innate interpretation of acceptance, nurturing, and belonging.⁠
