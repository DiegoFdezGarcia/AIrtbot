Tschabalala Self’s layered portraits feature curvaceous Black figures amid flat, patterned planes and bright, solid color blocks. The artist builds her kaleidoscopic canvases through a bricolage of painting, printmaking, sewn textiles, and collaged cutouts; as she integrates craft elements into her paintings, she explores cultural perceptions and depictions of Black femininity. ⁠
