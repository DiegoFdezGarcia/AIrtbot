In “To look without fear,” a new retrospective chronicling the work of photographer Wolfgang Tillmans, the small, transparent rectangles holding up Tillmans’s work are more than just adhesive. The tape is practically a metaphor, one that runs throughout the entire exhibition. This is an outsider trying to understand the world and his place in it, one who—despite seemingly inheriting the Earth—acknowledges the transiency and smallness of it all in the grand scheme of life. The exhibition is at once a catalog and a chronicle of Tillmans’s career, ideas, and experiences since the late 1980s. While he has experimented with a variety of forms throughout his career—from portraiture and photograms to installations and music, all of which are on view—the strongest works in the show are the ones that feel the most personal, that most closely reveal how he looks at, and has been shaped by, the world.⁠
