“The Freedom We Fight For," a new painting by Stanley Whitney (@stanley.whitney), will be featured in an upcoming single-lot benefit auction hosted by Artsy (@artsy), in partnership with Gagosian. All proceeds from the sale will support Art for Justice Fund (@art4justicefund) and Planned Parenthood of Greater New York (@ppgnyact) in their respective urgent fights for decarceration and criminal justice reform and reproductive rights in the United States. 

Pieced together from vibrant rectilinear fields divided by horizontal bands of red, blue, and teal, this abstract painting underscores Whitney’s facility as a colorist. The artwork will be on view at Gagosian, Park & 75, New York, during the auction, which runs from September 27 to October 7. Follow the link in our bio to learn more or register to bid!
