The atmosphere felt undeniably chic and cool as the 2022 edition of The Armory Show opened its doors to VIPs on Thursday afternoon. Now in its second year at the Javits Center and in its September slot, the New York fair was blessed with excellent breezy weather and an increased audience due to the lifting of COVID-19 travel restrictions for international exhibitors and attendees. The fair was also timed well to coincide with New York Fashion Week and the U.S. Open—concurrent events known to draw culturally minded out-of-towners into the city. There were celebrity sightings (like Jared Leto and Roxane Gay), record sales, and fashionable attendees—all of which contributed to the indisputable buzz that permeated in the air. The Armory Show executive director Nicole Berry put it well when she told Artsy towards the end of the day, “New York is back!”⁠
