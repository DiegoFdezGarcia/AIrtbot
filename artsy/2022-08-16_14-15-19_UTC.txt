Arghavan Khosravi weaves Persian motifs and Surrealist iconography into ghostly, enigmatic figurative paintings that thematize gender, censorship, and cultural transience. The Iranian-born artist holds two MFAs: one in illustration from the University of Tehran, and another in painting from the Rhode Island School of Design. In her richly symbolic mixed-media work, which often features thread, Khosravi untangles the complex relationship between authoritarianism, prejudice, and restrictions for women across cultural milieu.⁠
