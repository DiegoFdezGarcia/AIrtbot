Alvin Armstrong’s latest show at Anna Zorina Gallery (@annazorinagallery) features a series of paintings depicting the artist’s dear friend, Miles, in candid poses of dance performance. Together they use their chosen media to convey a viscerally powerful, intimate narrative. Collect works from the show on Artsy through the link in our bio until November 26th.
