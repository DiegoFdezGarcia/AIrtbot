Tao Siqi’s practice of painting originates from her seeking of metaphors hidden under the surface of an object. The positive and negative grounds of an object intrigue her to explore its emotional undercurrent on the canvas. The unusual subjects in Tao’s paintings transcend their signifiers, and reflect the tension between reality and illusion. Rooting in her keen observation and sensitive perception of the times we live in, her works aim to trigger personal emotional experiences through the construction, extension, and deconstruction of images.⁠
