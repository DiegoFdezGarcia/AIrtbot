Curated by New York-based gallerist Hannah Traore (@hannahtraore), "Don't Touch My Hair" is a collection of works exploring the cultural, spiritual, and personal significance of hair. "Whether body hair, head hair, hair tools, made with hair, inspired by hair, or interesting representations of hair, this collection celebrates hair as a symbol of beauty, power, and identity," Traore writes. After Traore's own hypothyroid diagnosis and subsequent hair loss, hair became a potent symbol and source of creative inspiration for the gallerist. "Losing my hair felt like losing a right; like losing a freedom I would have honored for both my Black and Jewish ancestors."
