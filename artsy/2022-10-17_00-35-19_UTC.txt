Jean-Marie Appriou’s latest show at MASSIMODECARLO (@massimodecarlogallery) marks the French artist's first solo presentation with the gallery and his debut exhibition in the UK. Titled “Ophelia,” the exhibition finds inspiration in Victorian artist Sir John Everett Millais’ painting of the character from William Shakespeare's play Hamlet, who tragically drowns in a river. Explore and inquire on works from the show on Artsy through the link in our bio until November 12th.⁠
