Throughout her long career, painter Maria Lassnig obsessively explored the idea of “body awareness,” which translated corporeal sensation to canvas. Via color and line, she aimed to depict how doubt, anxiety, tenderness, and grief really felt in the body. Though Lassnig’s practice ranged from spare abstractions to vivid portraits, and eventually to film, her major subject remained her own, visceral experience. The artist always seemed to be working out the same problems: how to see oneself clearly; how to delineate one’s boundaries; and how to reconcile one’s interiority and exteriority.⁠
