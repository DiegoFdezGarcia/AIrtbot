Ella Walker cleverly combines medieval allegories with the woes of contemporary womanhood in her flamboyant, large-scale, fresco-like paintings. The Manchester-born and London-based artist creates shallow, flatly pigmented backgrounds and highly texturized foregrounds. With chalk, pencil, ink, and tempera, she depicts female figures with medieval flourishes. Her work is dynamic, theatrical, and pointed. Walker engages with art historical styles and forms, inserting her own voice and vision to generate new depictions of women and the limited roles society has offered them, from the medieval age through today. ⁠
