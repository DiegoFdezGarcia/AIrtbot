Fernando Botero’s latest show at Opera Gallery (@operagallery) features over a dozen canvases, works on paper, and sculptures by the Colombian contemporary artist. Botero—multifaceted in his approach and distinct in style—was influenced by the Italian Renaissance, pre-Columbian art, and folklore from his native country. Explore and inquire on works from the show on Artsy through the link in our bio until October 22th.⁠
