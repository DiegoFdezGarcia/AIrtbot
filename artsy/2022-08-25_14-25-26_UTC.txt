Since the 1960s, Washington Color School painter Sam Gilliam has tested the boundaries of color, form, texture, abstraction, and the canvas itself. Throughout his canvases and works on paper, the artist has also employed various folding and staining techniques. Inspired by the spirit of improvisational jazz, Gilliam continues to experiment with depth, physicality, and resonances of color.⁠
