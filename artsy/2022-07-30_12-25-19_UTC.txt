Salvo was an Italian modernist painter and sculptor known for his conceptual practice; he later transitioned to richly colored metaphysical landscapes and cityscapes that recall the works of Giorgio de Chirico. Early in his career, Salvo was associated with the 1960s Turin Arte Povera movement. He shared a studio with Alighiero Boetti during this period, and the two had a reciprocal influence on one another’s practices. He had begun painting by the mid-1970s, blending real and imagined spaces to create simplified, hyper-saturated compositions that imply abstract concepts like time and memory.⁠
