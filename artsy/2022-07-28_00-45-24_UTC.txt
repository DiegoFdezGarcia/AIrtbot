Edin Zenun’s latest show at Bastian (@bastian.gallery) features twenty-six abstract paintings exploring relations between music, utopian political philosophy, art history, and lavatory graffiti, among other things. Titled “Lullaby for Realville,” Zenun’s newest body of work marries disparate influences in a process he likens to musical sampling. Explore and inquire on works from the show on Artsy through the link in our bio until August 13th.⁠
