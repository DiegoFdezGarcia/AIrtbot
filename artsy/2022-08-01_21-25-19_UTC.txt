The Federal Bureau of Investigation’s recent raid of the Orlando Museum of Art showed the power of provenance, or a record of an artwork’s ownership history: According to the affidavit used to obtain the search warrant, the origin stories of 25 Jean-Michel Basquiat works, which also weren’t authenticated by his estate, didn’t check out. Provenance, if done well, is an important part of assuring that works are authentic. In some cases—like with anything several hundreds of years old, or older—it can be a convincing way to give it that metaphorical stamp of approval.⁠
