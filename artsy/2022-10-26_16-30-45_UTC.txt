Frank Bowling’s luminous abstractions are made through a process that can best be described as a baptism. His relationship with paint is alchemical. Working like a wizard, he pours paints, metallics, gold powder, and ammonia into a cauldron to make a concoction that he then spills forth onto the canvas. “There’s so much water in his work, I’m surprised the paintings don’t drown,” said longtime studio assistant and friend Spencer Richards. But as Richards, as well as Bowling’s sons Ben and Sacha Bowling, said, the paintings do drown, like a baptism, only to be resuscitated into their final form.⁠
