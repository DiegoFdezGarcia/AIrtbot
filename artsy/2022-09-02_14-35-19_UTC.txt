Raymond Pettibon emerged from Southern California DIY culture and its punk-rock sensibility, and his work still embraces a youthful edginess and sense of political engagement. Drawing from disparate cultural sources—which range from Marcel Proust and William Blake to the Bible—the artist makes cartoon-inspired ink drawings on paper that evoke the aesthetics of fanzines and concert flyers. Baseball players, trains, crashing waves, political figures, and comic book characters make frequent appearances, often accompanied by cryptic, ironic snippets of handwritten text. ⁠
