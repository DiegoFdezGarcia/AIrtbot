Working in the style of Indo-Persian miniature painting, Hiba Schahbaz uses water-based pigment and black tea to capture the beauty and fragility of the nude female form. Whether the Pakistan-born, New York–based artist situates her female figures in the natural world or in domestic settings, they always challenge the conventions of the male gaze. While Schahbaz bases her paintings on photos she’s taken of her own body, her canvases offer universal stories about freedom, sexuality, and censorship.⁠
