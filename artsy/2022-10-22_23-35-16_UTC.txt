Going into last week’s London auctions, widespread signs of an economic slowdown suggested that the sales might be tepid, but that was largely not the case. Multiple reports have confirmed that auctions were managed well, with lots withdrawn to shore up strong sell-through rates. And though there were few (if any) of the meteoric results we witnessed for contemporary artists in the spring and summer, a slate of fresh records were set and notable debuts made. At the link in our bio, we share a selection of the artists whose works surpassed past auction results. They range from undersung 20th-century masters to promising emerging artists new to the secondary market. ⁠
