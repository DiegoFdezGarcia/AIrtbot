The masterful works of artists Emily Mae Smith and Corrine Wasmuht are on view at a pair of shows at Petzel Gallery in New York. Emily Mae Smith’s beguiling figuration blends elements of Surrealism, Symbolism, and Pop art with a distinctly feminist aesthetic, while Corinne Wasmuht paints several images atop one another in her large-scale oil on wood works, resulting in near-abstract compositions. Explore and inquire on works from the shows on Artsy through the link in our bio.
