Spencer Lewis creates freestanding, mixed-media paintings that engage both sides of the canvas. Beginning with extensive studies comprised of sketches and digital paintings, he then works with a variety of media: acrylics, spray paint, tape, yarn, pastels, cardboard, graphite-on-canvas, and other sculptural materials. Colorful and vigorously gestural, his paintings incorporate narrative elements, symbolism, and biomorphic forms. The combination of meticulous study and improvisation amounts to works that resist easy categorization, while their three-dimensionality allows Lewis to facilitate a sculptural relationship between the paintings and their surrounding space, inviting viewers to traverse them and undergo evolving impressions of the work.⁠
