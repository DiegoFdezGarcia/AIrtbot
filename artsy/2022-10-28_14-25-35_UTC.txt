With her lively, gestural explosions of color and form, Joan Mitchell solidified her place in the predominantly masculine Abstract Expressionist movement that emerged in mid-century New York. The artist’s epic, large-scale abstractions feature all-over gestural brushwork and bold color palettes that hint at their original source material: Landscapes, sunflowers, and the natural world were favorite motifs. While Mitchell spent her early career in New York, she eventually moved to the French countryside, where her work incorporated palettes and shapes that reflected the pastoral setting.⁠
