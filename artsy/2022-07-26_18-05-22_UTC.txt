Lenz Geerk’s figurative paintings evoke cinema in their reliance on ambience, their depictions of movement and stillness, and their ability to connect with audiences. Geerk generates mood and emotion with compositions and hues that feel inspired by memory. The artist’s muted palettes capture ineffable, everyday moments that are fraught with ambiguity and angst. Although Geerk’s work feels personal, it is not autobiographical. The artist uses varied source materials and often paints over his own compositions. A single finished canvas might feature many unfinished layers beneath, a technique that generates its own sense of memory and time. ⁠
