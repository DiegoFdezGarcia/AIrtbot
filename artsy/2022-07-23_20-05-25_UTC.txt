Claes Oldenburg, who died on July 18th at the age of 93, wrote in 1961 what would become one of the most famous art manifestos: “I am for an art that is political-erotical-mystical, that does something other than sit on its ass in a museum,” he began. “I am for all art that takes its form from the lines of life itself, that twists and extends and accumulates and spits and drips, and is heavy and coarse and blunt and sweet and stupid as life itself.” The Swedish-born American Pop artist insisted that this text was not rallying cry, nor a reflection of his own beliefs, but rather a “poetic ode” to the art movement he and his peers pursued. Still, it’s a fitting sentiment for Oldenburg’s mind-expanding, boundary-breaking oeuvre.⁠
