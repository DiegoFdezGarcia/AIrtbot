Richard Bosman is a Neo-Expressionist figurative painter and printmaker whose work draws on the dramatic pop culture imagery of comic books, pulp fiction, illustration, and B movies. Bosman was a member of the New York artist collective Colab, and exhibited at the group’s influential “Times Square” show in 1980 alongside Keith Haring, Jean-Michel Basquiat, and Judy Rifka. His focus has since shifted to rural Americana, nocturnal cityscapes, burning kitchen appliances, and depictions of the Adirondack wilderness, even as he frequently retains the same narrative ambiguity and Pop sensibility of his earlier work. Bosman works in a variety of printmaking techniques, including woodcut, etching, lithography, screenprinting, and monoprint.⁠
