🎵 Artsy Mixtape 027 just dropped on Spotify, curated by artist Hassan Hajjaj (@hassanhajjaj_larache). Hassan Hajjaj’s exuberant portraits capture the cultural multiplicity that animates the streets of Morocco, where the artist grew up. Hajjaj’s practice spans myriad disciplines including sculpture, video, fashion, photography, and performance, but he is perhaps best known for his bright photographs of stylishly dressed subjects who pose in front of patterned backgrounds. The artist places his pictures in custom frames that feature borders inset with commercial goods such as cans of tomato sauce or motor oil. “These songs are a part of my journey from growing up in Morocco and London, and the influences from friends around the globe,” Hajjaj told Artsy. From Goldie to Dennis Brown, drop into Spotify to hear the songs that have inspired the artist through the link in our bio.⁠
