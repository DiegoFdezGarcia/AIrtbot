For our current Post-War and Contemporary sale, Artsy partnered with Cereus Art (@cereus.art), an organization that provides tools for emerging artists of color to build a financially stable art practice. Those services include financial education, partnerships with online auctions, and mentorship for artists who aren’t represented by a gallery. Artsy spoke with Cereus founder Emma Nuzzo to learn more about the difficulties emerging artists of color face as they attempt to navigate the art market. ⁠
