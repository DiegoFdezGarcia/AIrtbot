Tracey Emin’s poetic, confessional practice spans film, painting, neon, embroidery, drawing, installation, and sculpture. A member of the infamous generational cohort known as the Young British Artists (YBAs), Emin has developed a unique conceptual mode of artmaking that embraces both tenderness and audacity. In her era-defining works, Emin has mined her most intimate experiences for artistic inspiration.⁠
