In his paintings, Rolankay presents scenes with characters and spaces made of blocks of heavy, pure and vertiginous colours, appealing to synthesis in the image. As a self-taught painter, his school were the art books he encountered as an adult in the Santiago Public Library; thus, his visual culture navigates freely between the past and the present. His flat, contrasting colours move between minimalist interiors and desolate, deserted landscapes, with uninhibited perspectives alluding to aspects of modernism.⁠
