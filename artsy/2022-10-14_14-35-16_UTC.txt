Disillusioned with the art world’s emphasis on commercialism, Jen Mann views her paintings as physical and visual manifestations of ideas rather than as products. Her art is conceptual and often begins as written phrases in a journal. Mann uses color as a storytelling technique, evoking elements of identity and interpersonal relationships in her paintings.⁠
