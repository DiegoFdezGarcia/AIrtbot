Thomas Ruff’s photography embraces the full material possibilities of the medium. The artist uses a range of techniques spanning from antiquated darkroom production to digital manipulation as he explores authenticity, appropriation, and the boundaries of photography as an art form; his interests align more with conceptual art than with documentary or staged photography, and his subjects span portraiture, landscapes, nudes, architecture, and abstract forms.⁠
