🎵 Artsy Mixtape 029 just dropped on Spotify, curated by Julie Curtiss. Curtiss’ practice undermines stereotypes of femininity, from unsettling paintings of intricate hairstyles to starkly framed or severed body parts. Working in the loosely defined style of Neo-Surrealism, the French-born, Brooklyn-based artist uses her uncanny compositions to challenge standards of beauty. “I compiled these songs from albums or artists which are on repeat in the studio,” Curtiss told Artsy. “I also wanted it to feel like a mix, evolving like a work day.” From Frank Ocean to Radiohead, drop into Spotify to hear the songs that have inspired the artist through the link in our bio.⁠
