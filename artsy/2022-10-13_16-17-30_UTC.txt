For this year’s edition of BMW Open Work, Los Angeles-based artist Nikita Gale presents an immersive installation “63/22” in the BMW Lounge at Frieze London. Drawing inspiration from BMW i7 designers, the commission explores the relationship between technologies of sound and technologies of speed and motion. Gale’s practice questions themes of invisibility and audibility, recasting the dynamic between performer and spectator. Within the work, notions of witnessing, visibility, and representation are subverted and destabilized.⁠
