New York and Warsaw–based artist Piotr Uklanski's installations, photography, collages, performances, and films often explore postwar European and American aesthetics and politics, with references including Art Brut—as in his resin paintings with heavy impasto surfaces and woven-fiber painting. Interested in the techniques of craft, Uklanski commonly uses inexpensive or vernacular materials in his art.⁠
