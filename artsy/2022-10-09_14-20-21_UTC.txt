Karin “Mamma” Andersson is an acclaimed painter whose distinct handling of materials, experimentations with perspective, and romantic depictions of Nordic interiors and countrysides have earned her such prestigious accolades as the Carnegie Art Award and the Daniel and Florence Guerlain Drawing Prize. Using imagery that suggests film stills and theater sets, Andersson creates panoramic landscapes and tableaux of everyday life, executed in a figurative painting style similar to those of Peter Doig and David Hockney. Andersson’s compositions often include hidden cultural references to books, movies, and paintings by other artists—details that imbue her works with a fragmented narrative that is both mysterious and familiar.⁠
