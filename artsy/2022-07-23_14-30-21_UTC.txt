Zwelethu Machepha’s layered, kaleidoscopic paintings depict the complexities of the artist’s fellow Johannesburg residents. Machepha incorporates charcoal, embroidery, acrylics, India ink, watercolors, and pastels into his close-up portraits, which often feature eyes, noses, and mouths multiplied and collaged across single faces to evoke a sense of transience and multiplicity. ⁠
