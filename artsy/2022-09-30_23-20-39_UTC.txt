The Carnegie International, the longest-running North American presentation of international art, opened its 58th edition at the Carnegie Museum of Art in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, on September 24th. Featuring work by over 100 artists and collectives, the 2022 iteration of the International necessitated not only a Pittsburgh-based curatorial team, but a broader international curatorial council and advisory group to help create and shape the exhibition. The broader curatorial team chose not to respond to the pressures of the art market or celebrity culture, and instead focused on using this opportunity to bring different artistic voices to the forefront of international art, seeking works that reflected many versions of the idea of “contemporary.” At the link in our bio, we share eight standout artists from this year’s Carnegie International who explore complex histories and address critical issues of our time.⁠
