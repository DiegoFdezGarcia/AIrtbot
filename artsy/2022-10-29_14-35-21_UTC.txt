Fan Ho, earned his fame as one Asia’s most beloved street photographers capturing Hong Kong in the 50’s and 60’s. He had the patience to wait for ‘the decisive moment’; very often a collision of the unexpected, framed against a very clever composed background of geometrical construction and texture. He also liked to create drama and atmosphere with backlit effects or through the combination of smoke and light. His favorite locations were the streets, alleys, and markets around dusk when the sun would cast long shades of life on the sea.⁠
