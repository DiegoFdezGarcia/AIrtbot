Amoako Boafo’s luminous portraits make and hold space for Black joy, subjectivity, and self-determination. The artist highlights his subjects’ complexity with his own tender touch; he uses his fingers to paint their unique gazes, poses, and dress. Boafo was as an artist in residence at the Rubell Museum in 2019, and the next year, he was featured in The Artsy Vanguard 2020.⁠
