Through conceptual art, artists are able to critique the tension of culture and lived experience to directly address systemic racism and sexism. It provides an avenue to provoke institutions and audiences to critically reevaluate their relationship to power. Black conceptual artists are restoring access to the knowledge of their histories by framing their Black subjectivity as a generative source of intellectual possibility. By reclaiming this weight of culture, Black artists are able to treat lived experiences as specialized, hyper-specific histories that cannot be easily reduced to simplistic interpretation by others.⁠
