Issy Wood’s paintings function like a mercurial Tumblr moodboard from the early 2010s. Drafted in a stream-of-consciousness style, the works appear to be both intimate and deeply impersonal. Conveyed with a deft painterly hand, Wood’s style is both a play on Pop Art and Surrealism. With an emphasis on mundane household items, Wood’s paintings and the trancelike state in which objects, like a gold tooth or brown leather trench coat, appear leaves viewers wondering if this is real life or just fantasy.⁠
