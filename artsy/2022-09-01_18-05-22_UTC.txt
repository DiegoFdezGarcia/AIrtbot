Maria Klabin’s latest show at Nara Roesler (@galerianararoesler) marks the Brazilian artist’s first solo show in the United States. Titled “Liquid Air,” the exhibition reveals painting as an unfolding of the artist's practice in other fields, such as dance, sculpture, and photography. Explore and inquire on works from the show on Artsy through the link in our bio until October 15th.⁠
