The sensuous mixed-media artworks of Bea Bonafini feature harmonious color palettes and fluid imagery, and showcase her painterly approach to materials such as ceramic and textiles. Bonafini has described painting as both her first love and as “a suit that was too tight.” Although she still paints, Bonafini has also experimented with her own sewn and knitted fabrics, as well as immersive installations and dance pieces. She collages pieces of carpet to produce dense patterns of overlapping figures that resemble the paper cut-outs of Henri Matisse. The artist uses a range of soft, tactile materials in her hybrid works, including cork, textiles, and PVC.⁠
