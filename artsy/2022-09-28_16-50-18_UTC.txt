Nina Chanel Abney’s latest show at Pace Prints (@paceprints) centers on the artist’s monumental works on paper, a medium that has developed into a pillar of Abney’s practice over four years of collaboration with Pace Editions’ master printers. Titled “Framily Ties—You Win Some, You Lose Some,” the intentionally misspelled exhibition celebrates a progression of Nina Chanel Abney’s approach to printmaking, both in scale and complexity. Explore and inquire on works from the show on Artsy through the link in our bio until November 12th.⁠
