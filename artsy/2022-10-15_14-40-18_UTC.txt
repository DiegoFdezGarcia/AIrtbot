In her ever-evolving practice, Arlene Shechet uses diverse materials—including concrete, ceramic, wood, tinted resin, and steel—in large-scale, abstract sculptures that conjure movement and fluidity even as they remain static in the gallery space. Since her first museum survey in 2015, at Boston’s Institute of Contemporary Art, the New York–born and –based artist has enjoyed solo shows at the Phillips Collection in Washington, D.C., and the Frick Collection in New York. “I am trying to have the viewer find a kind of empathy with the experience of these body-sized pieces finding their balance,” Shechet told Artsy. ⁠
