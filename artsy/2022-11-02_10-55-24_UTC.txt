Gérard Schneider's major retrospective at Perrotin (@galerieperrotin) is now open at the gallery's 8 Matignon location in Paris. In the mid-1930s, Schneider joined the abstraction revolution initiated by Kandinsky, while also exploring new horizons introduced by Surrealism. In the effervescence of the post-war period, Schneider’s art played a pioneering role in the birth of Lyrical Abstraction. Collect works from the show on Artsy through the link in our bio until December 17.⁠
