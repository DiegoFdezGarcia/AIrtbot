GaHee Park’s surreal paintings and drawings—rendered with flat planes of saturated color—offer illicit glimpses of intimate moments and erotic fantasies. Exploring themes of desire, pleasure, and the division between public and private, her canvases portray entangled couples and solitary nude women, often set in domestic interiors that feature cocktails, fanciful foods, flora, and fauna. The artist fills her lush scenes with uncanny details—limbs are detached or too long, for example, while some subjects are fragmented by mirrors, furniture, and windows. Often, a figure lurks near the central scene, adding a sense of voyeurism to the composition. Park’s unabashedly erotic canvases reject both the sexual repression of the artist’s strict Catholic upbringing and the sexist depictions of women in the art historical canon.⁠
