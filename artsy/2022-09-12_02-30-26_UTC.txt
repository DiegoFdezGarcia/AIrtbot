“Don’t let darkness be a running theme,” Hugo McCloud continually reminded himself while working on his solo presentation with Sean Kelly Gallery at this year’s Armory Show and his upcoming exhibition at Vielmetter Los Angeles. “The context from which the paintings come may be dark, but my images are not,” he told Artsy from his studio in Los Angeles, where McCloud recently moved after previously residing in Tulum, Mexico. Flowers—particularly those the artist photographed on sellers’ pushcarts in Mexico—are the subject of paintings that challenge the natural essence of botany through McCloud’s choice of artificial material. Single-use plastic bags replace paint’s established command to capture the elated hues and velvety lushness of flowers.⁠
