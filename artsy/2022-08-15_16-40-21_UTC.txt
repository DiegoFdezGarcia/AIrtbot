In her own words, the work of multimedia artist Kysa Johnson “explores patterns in nature that exist at the extremes of scale,” or realities “invisible to the naked eye.” Johnson’s compositions are based on visualizations of the macro- and microscopic, though their sources are not immediately apparent. What looks like lush still lifes and landscapes might actually be depictions of diseases and their cures, maps of the universe, or molecular structures. Johnson has also created a number of site-specific installations depicting landscapes; in each case, the work’s composition is based on imagery from the area in which the site is located.⁠
