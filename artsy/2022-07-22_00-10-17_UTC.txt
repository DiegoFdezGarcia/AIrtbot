Twin brothers Sam and Daniel Kapp work from two adjacent desktop computers at their eponymous Tribeca gallery. “We are a two-person team, running the entire operation,” Sam said. Hidden in the back of Kapp Kapp—whose current group show, “Lingua Franca,” features work from Susan Cianciolo, Richard Tuttle, Louis Osmosis, gallery artist Hannah Beerman, and others—the purple computers echo the color of the three-year-old gallery’s similarly hued butterfly logo. This attention to detail is shared by the partners, but the backgrounds that brought them to co-run their own space are quite different.⁠
