Szabolcs Bozó's strong performance on the secondary market, impressive social media following, and recent institutional recognition reveal collectors’ growing interest in works that draw inspiration from animation rendered with a striking street-art technique. This style has become a consistent marker with other artists like Katherine Bernhardt, Robert Nava, and Eddie Martinez. For Bozó, the bright graphic style is a way to grab the audience’s eye and lure them into a complex, fantastical landscape of creatures inspired by the nursery rhymes and dark humor of his youth. With the current Sotheby’s sale, it is not hard to foresee Bozó’s successes with Asian and European markets and institutions being replicated in the U.S⁠
