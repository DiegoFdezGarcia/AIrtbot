Spiritual abstractions—lush, divinely inspired paintings by artists such as Sonia Delaunay, Hilma af Klint, and Agnes Pelton—have permeated the white cube over the past few years. And for good reason: Hallucinatory geometries, explosive hues, and absorbing patterns are especially appealing in an age of systemic failures, illness, uncertainty, and climate catastrophe. Spiritual abstractions take us to entirely different realms. Following this trend, the previously overlooked Norwegian painter Anna-Eva Bergman is now getting her due. Her recent popularity also coincides with ongoing reconsiderations of 20th-century female painters. Thanks to recent institutional and gallery support, collectors and the broader art viewing public are now appreciating the artist’s mysticism and material ingenuity more than ever.⁠
