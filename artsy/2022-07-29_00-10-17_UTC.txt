Joel Meyerowitz helped popularize color photography as a fine art form in the 1960s, when black-and-white pictures were still dominant. Inspired by major documentary photographers Henri Cartier-Bresson and Robert Frank, Meyerowitz has focused his lens on unposed subjects which have ranged from New York City inhabitants to small-town scenes and Provincetown beachgoers. Meyerowitz is self-taught, though he began his practice after working with Frank on an advertising shoot in the 1960s (Meyerowitz was an art director at the time). ⁠
