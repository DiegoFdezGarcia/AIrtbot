Audun Alvestad’s work depicts expansive beaches and water parks rendered with a keen eye for intimacy, movement, and the relationship between bodies. His paintings explore the tension between loneliness and community. Through a soothing color palette and surreal scenarios, the artist places the viewer in dialogue with the works; we’re left to wonder if the scenes on view are drawn from memory, reality, or a dream. And like much of Alvestad’s work, the answer is all three.⁠
