Two lots by the late Hugh Steers sold for far more than their estimates at auction in New York this week. The American figurative painter, whose promising career was cut short when he died of AIDS-related complications in 1995 at just 32, is known for his fearless depictions of gay life, often rendered in quiet interiors tinged with symbolism and art-historical allusions. Steers is notable, too, for his embrace of representational art in the 1980s and ’90s, a time when the style was largely considered outmoded. Steers’s reemergence in the art market underscores galleries’ amplified commitment to queer artists, as well as the broader art world’s drive to uncover previously overlooked talents who never got the recognition they deserved. Moreover, Steers’s recent success at auction speaks to the current trend of artists’ secondary-market works exceeding presale estimates shortly after a major auction debut. Repeat performances like this one are strong indicators: both that the original debut sales weren’t mere aberrations—that there’s real collector interest in these artists—and that even in the face of inflation and economic uncertainty, collectors remain eager to invest in art by underrecognized creators.⁠
