From October 12th through 16th, the tents at Regent’s Park thrummed with excitement as visitors to Frieze London and Frieze Masters enjoyed the spectacular booths of the much-anticipated art fair. Collectors, curators, and art enthusiasts alike were spellbound at the rich displays of global talent on view—most of which were snapped up within the opening hours of the fair on Wednesday. Celebrity attendees included Her Royal Highness Princess Beatrice, tennis star Maria Sharapova, former chancellor Rishi Sunak, actor Jared Leto, and Taiwanese singer Jay Chou, among others. “What truly matters is that amongst everything, the creative spirit of London remains untouched,” said Eva Langret, artistic director of Frieze London. “It’s a moment for us to get together and rally in support for the wider creative community in London. If we’ve learned one thing, it’s that the art market is resilient, so we have a lot of confidence this year.”⁠
