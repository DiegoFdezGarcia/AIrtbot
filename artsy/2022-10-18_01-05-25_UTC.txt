Mire Lee creates carnivorous mechanical sculptures that evoke the vulnerability of the human body. Using clay, steel, pumps, hoses, blades, and motor power, Lee creates revolting yet deeply engaging pieces that form a cacophonous, swirling web of bodily desire amid an ever-looming threat of violence. For Lee, desire is deadly. This past year has seen Lee’s morbid mechanic installations reach a broader, global audience. The Seoul-born and -based artist, who splits her time between there and Amsterdam, has been the subject of numerous exhibitions following her exceptional inclusion in the 59th Venice Biennale’s main exhibition “The Milk of Dreams,” curated by Cecilia Alemani.⁠
