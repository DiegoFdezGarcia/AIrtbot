🎵 Artsy Mixtape 025 just dropped on Spotify, curated by artist Katherine Bernhardt (@kbernhardt2014). In bright, expressive paintings of pop culture characters, food, and consumer goods, Katherine Bernhardt explores the mundane iconography of contemporary society. The artist riffs on similar patterns or motifs across a number of canvases: E.T., the Pink Panther, shoes, and tropical fruits have been common refrains. Her distinctive painting style finds the connective tissue between graffiti, color fields, and action painting. “This is music I listen to in my studio, and in my Jeep cruising around. I like to sing in my studio alone really loud and sing in my car,” Bernhardt told Artsy. “It's a form of singing therapy for me.” From Bad Bunny to J Balvin, drop into Spotify to hear the songs that have inspired Katherine Bernhardt’s work through the link in our bio.⁠
