“1-800 Happy Birthday,” a powerful new exhibition at the East Williamsburg-based nonprofit Worthless Studios (@worthlessstudios), honors the lives of individuals lost to police violence. Originally conceived as an audio archival project by the filmmaker and artist Mohammad Gorjestani (@mohammadnonprophet), “1-800 Happy Birthday” explores the moments of quiet and grief that persist long after media coverage, in the form of birthday messages recorded for loved ones after their passing. The 12 celebrants honored in this exhibition are Dujuan Armstrong, Sandra Bland, Philando Castile, Stephon Clark, Fred Cox, Eric Garner, Oscar Grant, Xzavier Hill, Donovon Lynch, Sean Monterrosa, Tony Robinson, and Mario Woods. The exhibition is on view through January 16 at 7 Knickerbocker Avenue, Brooklyn.
