Just refreshed: Trove. The best works on Artsy this week, all available now. This week’s Trove collection features a serene watercolor-and-ink piece awash in muted colors by Emma Larsson; a jewel-toned abstract canvas recalling stained glass by Michael Childress; and a vibrant, carved wood sculpture resembling aquatic plants by Matthew Ronay.⁠
