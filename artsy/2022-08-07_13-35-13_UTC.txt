Woody De Othello’s surreal clay sculptures take the shape of household objects that appear to melt, sigh, and twist themselves into knots. With his distinctly contemporary approach to ceramics, De Othello recreates mundane fixtures such as box fans, light switches, and telephones. He embraces a humorous style that nevertheless offers serious reflections on our domestic lives.⁠
