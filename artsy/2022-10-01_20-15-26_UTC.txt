vanessa german describes herself as an artist working from the studio of her soul, carefully observing and honoring the mystery of life that she then transfers into “portrait sculptures,” as she calls them. Amalgams of Black culture cobbled together through found objects like jeans and quilts, german’s evocative, bulbous, life-sized figures are dressed in clothes that extend and morph their shape, size, and appearance. These wood sculptures are not idle objects, but are imbued with all the intentionality and emotions that german carried while crafting them.⁠
