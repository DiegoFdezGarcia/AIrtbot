British-Nigerian artist Sola Olulode creates delicate portrayals of queer love through her figurative works. Influenced by Yoruba Adire textiles, Olulode renders intimate scenes of romance and Black womanhood. Her works are lively yet potent; we witness tender narratives unfold across the canvas. Olulode was featured in Artsy’s 2021 “Portrayals of Black Joy” campaign, which saw her work appear on public screens within the transit systems of several major U.S. cities.⁠
