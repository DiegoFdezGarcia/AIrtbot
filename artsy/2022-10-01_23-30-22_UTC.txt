Rafael de Cárdenas' approach to curating and collecting is expansive, forgoing academic strictures and trendy marketability. Instead, de Cárdenas intuitively appreciates how disparate objects might connect. His own collection, for example, includes paintings by the little-known folk artist Ralph Redpath, pottery by New Mexico–based chef Johnny Santiago Adao Ortiz-Concha, and a tuft of hair by Yuji Agematsu. “I have a very short attention span. I get easily bored with things,” de Cárdenas told Artsy. “I don’t think I have an approach—there’s this idea that there’s a kind of tornado, and things are getting grabbed at along the way.”⁠
