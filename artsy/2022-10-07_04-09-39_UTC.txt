Pamela Phatsimo Sunstrum’s latest show at Galerie Lelong & Co. (@galerielelong) marks the artist’s first major solo exhibition in New York. Titled “I Have Withheld Much More Than I Have Written,” the exhibition journeys into processes of disintegration—processes that are at once intimate, violent, sensual, madding, and tender—in the pursuit of home and wholeness. Explore and inquire on works from the powerful show on Artsy through the link in our bio until October 22nd.
