üéµ Artsy Mixtape 028 just dropped on Spotify, curated by Bosco Sodi (@studioboscosodi). Bosco Sodi considers geology and memory throughout his textured paintings and sculptures. To create vibrant topographies on his canvases, Sodi mixes materials including sawdust, wood, pulp, natural fibers, and glue with raw, vivid pigments, at times made from lapis lazuli, indigo, or soot. He makes his sculptures from earth and volcanic material that he sources from his native Mexico. Of his mixtape, Sodi told Artsy, ‚ÄúThese are all songs that I grew up listening to and they are an important part of who I am now. I come from a family of which music plays a fundamental role in our day-to-day lives.‚Äù From The Cure to Tracy Chapman, drop into Spotify to hear the songs that have inspired the artist through the link in our bio.‚Å†
