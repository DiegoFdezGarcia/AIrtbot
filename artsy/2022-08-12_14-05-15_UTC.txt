Faye Wei Wei’s poetic paintings feature symbolic reveries and mythical iconography. The artist combines pastel hues with muted earth tones to render a unique feminine symbology she derives from folklore and art history. The results are dreamlike, exploring psychological terrain as well as broader social concerns: Wei Wei is interested in the performances of gender and love.⁠
