Artsy is honored to present "Impact: Immediate Abortion Access Fund," an auction to support reproductive justice for all. With the subtitle “We Deliver Our Bodies,” curatorial collective Grandma has gathered standout works by generations of artists who staunchly advocate for bodily autonomy and reproductive rights. A portion of the proceeds from this auction will benefit Vote Save America’s Immediate Abortion Access Fund, which provides direct aid to patients and abortion clinics on the front lines of healthcare—namely those most affected by new abortion bans and restrictions in BIPOC, rural, and low-income communities. Bid through the link in our bio until October 13th.⁠
