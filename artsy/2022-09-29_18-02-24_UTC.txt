🎵 Artsy Mixtape 030 just dropped on Spotify, curated by Katie Stout. Katie Stout satirizes the trappings of domesticity and femininity with wry, whimsical sculptures and design objects. Working in a materially agnostic style she calls “naïve pop,” Stout pushes biomorphic forms and everyday materials to grotesque extremes. “The general theme of this playlist is to oscillate; for grinding your teeth and your hips,” the artist told Artsy. “A collage of feels, I recommend playing on shuffle.” From ABBA to Bruce Springsteen, drop into Spotify to hear the songs that have inspired the artist through the link in our bio.⁠
