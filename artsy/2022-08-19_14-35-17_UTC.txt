The subjects of Shirley Villavicencio Pizango’s figurative portraits appear as if posing for informal snapshots, but these intimate paintings teem with raucous pattern and loose, expressive brushwork. Although best known for her empathetic paintings of friends, family, and strangers, Pizango also paints self-portraits and still lifes in the same gestural style. Her works reflect her experiences of navigating different cultures, after growing up in Peru before moving to Ghent at the age of 18. Lush vegetation, which nods to her memories of the Peruvian rainforest, is a common motif in her work, as are geometric forms that suggest the ornamentation of Inca pottery. Pizango often paints with acrylics, which allows her to work relatively quickly, and she additionally works in sculpture and ceramics.⁠
