In Ulala Imai’s latest show at Karma (@karmakarma9), small moments are depicted with a vibrant intensity: a doll is nestled in a bed of flowers; an overripe banana and a golden teddy bear have an ebullient glow; a Star Wars figure stands guard on a windswept path; moonlight lingers on the branches of trees; a deer stands still before the woods. Titled “The Scene,” the show exemplifies  Imai’s ability to memorialize her subjects inside a delicate reality. Explore and inquire on works from the show on Artsy through the link in our bio until September 17th.
