Paris has always been a siren call to art lovers, and the draw is especially strong this October. The inaugural Paris+ par Art Basel, which aims to be a staple in the city’s buzzing arts and culture scene, opens at the Grand Palais Éphémère on October 20th. Meanwhile, over on the Left Bank, Asia Now celebrates its eighth edition this year, continuing its exploration of the diverse art scenes from West to Southeast Asia at its new home in Monnaie de Paris. If that were not enough to tempt you, outside the fairs is a dizzying array of vibrant, thought-provoking, and innovative museum and gallery shows. At the link in our bio, we share seven exhibitions in Paris that are not to be missed.⁠
