Alex Garant’s portraits focus on motion and optical illusions, suggesting her sitters are in flux in the corporal form, or perhaps, a representation of the multiple selves present in all of us. The theme and prevalence of motion originating in her characteristic “double eye” portraiture evolves further in her work. Thick undulations of paint are paired with realistically painted sitters, allowing a play on technique and contrast of gesticulation.⁠
