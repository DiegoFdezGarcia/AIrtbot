Jonathan Gardner’s highly stylized paintings joyfully reference a wealth of 20th-century art—from Henri Matisse’s interiors and René Magritte’s distinct objects to Pablo Picasso’s geometric bodies and Georges Seurat’s relaxed bathers. Featuring representational and Surrealist-esque imagery, his collage-like compositions are united by a spatial flatness. Gardner’s background line patterns and grids serve as wallpaper, flooring, and windows, and the artist renders clothing, furniture, houseplants, and body parts in rich palettes.⁠
