We’re thrilled to have partnered with Pace Gallery and Outfront to support teamLab’s first NFT project with special guest Grimes as part of a large-scale activation taking place in New York’s Times Square. Titled “Matter is Void,” the project examines notions of ownership and authorship through an inventive new format that allows collectors to change the content of the work.
