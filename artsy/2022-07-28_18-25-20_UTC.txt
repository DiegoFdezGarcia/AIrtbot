Clare Rojas, who is now 45 (a detail intimately noted in the signature at the bottom of her paintings), has been making work that harmonizes polar opposites—the good and the bad, joy and grief, hope and fear—for nearly 30 years. “I think my work has always teetered between chaos and the opposite of chaos. Serenity, maybe,” she told Artsy. “I’ve always been searching for that balance, and the magic is somewhere in the middle.”⁠
