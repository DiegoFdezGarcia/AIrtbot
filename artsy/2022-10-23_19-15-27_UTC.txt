At the inaugural edition of Paris + by Art Basel, BMW Art Journey winner 2021 Julien Creuzet presents a new work rooted in the Caribbean diaspora of Paris and Creuzet's ancestral home Martinique, a place he calls “the heart of my imagination". The work, titled "blue green sea bruise on the horizon,” is rooted in the observation of ELVs (end-of-life vehicles) in Martinique–wrecks of cars abandoned on the roadside and reinvested by vegetation. Julien Creuzet associates this inspiration with discovering the different stages of an automobile’s shaping during his visit to BMW factories in Munich.
