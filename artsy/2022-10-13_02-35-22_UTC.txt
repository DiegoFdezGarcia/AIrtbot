A year shy from its 20th anniversary, this year’s edition of Frieze London boasts more than 280 galleries from 46 countries, and programming that includes commissioned projects by Tyler Mitchell and Emma Talbot; a special section titled “Indra’s Net” featuring 10 dedicated presentations; and an outdoor wooden installation by 2022 Frieze Artist Award winner Abbas Zahedi. While Frieze anchors the calendar, local galleries and institutions have geared up ambitious programs—a reminder of the city’s status as an art world capital.⁠
