The paintings of Matthew Wong, who was on the precipice of massive art world success when he passed away in 2019, are testaments to a generational talent. The canvases, mostly rendered with oils or watercolors, are rife with spectral figuration, bold color palettes, and haunting, melancholic landscapes. The Toronto-born artist received an MFA in photography from the City University of Hong Kong in 2013 and turned to painting and drawing shortly after graduation; his self-taught technique derived from online forums and library books. Wong’s powerful paintings quickly attracted art world interest, and his 2018 debut New York solo show was an instant success. A second, posthumous show followed in 2019. Despite his tragically short career, Wong has become one of the most beloved artists in recent memory.⁠
