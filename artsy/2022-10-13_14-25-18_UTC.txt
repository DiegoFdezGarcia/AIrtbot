Through her multi-disciplinary practice spanning painting, drawing, and sculpture, Los Angeles–based artist Sarah Ann Weber presents compelling, brightly colored works. Weber is experimental with her practice, often using watercolor and colored pencils to create smooth textures. Her zestful works are multilayered, combining historical photographs with elaborate floral patterns and natural landscapes. Weber moves between gestural drawing techniques and fine, detailed linework to create striking works that explore gender and beauty.⁠
