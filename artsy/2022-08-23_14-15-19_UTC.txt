Sigrid von Lintig is best known for her almost photorealistic yet often blurred large-format paintings made with pigments and acrylic binder. Her motives vary from colliery buildings that marked her childhood in a coal mining area to scenes seemingly fresh from someone's family album, still lives, and snapshots from the municipal swimming hall she attends regularly.⁠
