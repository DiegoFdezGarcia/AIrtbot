Nanan Kang’s latest show at Seojung Art (@seojung_art) is a space of artistic sense and sensibility. Titled “Sitcom The Corn: EO.1- Corn Sweet Corn,” the exhibition invites us to intensively relish in the meaning of love and happiness—the cardinal theme of the artist’s oeuvre—and receive the positive message Nanan intends to share, as if watching a sitcom. Explore and inquire on works from the show on Artsy through the link in our bio until October 3rd.⁠
