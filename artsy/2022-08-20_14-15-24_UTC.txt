Tomo Campbell’s expressive large-scale oil paintings contain hidden shapes and characters that elicit double takes. Campbell’s abstracted scenes hide familiar motifs lifted from Neoclassical and Flemish art and painted in a soft pastel color palette reminiscent of Rococo. Campbell’s forms are fluid and suggestive, blending in with the layers of textured brushstrokes to form images that oscillate between figuration and abstraction.⁠
