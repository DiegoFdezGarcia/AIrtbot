“I think of her as a kind of orthopedic samurai,” said artist Emma Talbot, while looking wistfully at a textile sculpture that stands at the physical and thematic center of her new exhibition at the Whitechapel Gallery in London. The striking piece—which shares the show’s title, “The Age / L’Età”—depicts a life-size elderly woman, feet bent with bunions, shoulders hunched and head bowed. Sinuous wraps of purple fabric recall both the representations of muscles in Renaissance-era anatomical drawings and the body armor of ancient Rome. Talbot’s figure is both terrifying and powerful. Her thick, straight gray hair—a wig bought in Hackney—also looks remarkably similar to Talbot’s own. “The figures in my work are always an avatar of me,” Talbot said.⁠
