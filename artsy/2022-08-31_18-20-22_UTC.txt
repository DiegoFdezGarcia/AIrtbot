Anouk Lamm Anouk can often be found sporting sleek nightwear with their Yorkshire terrier, Sirius Grace Anouk, perched tenderly in their arms. “Ever since I was younger, I always felt more comfortable communicating with animals,” said the 29-year-old Austrian artist. “They are pure in their intentions.” Outlines of lambs, cats, and teddy bears are the main subjects of Anouk’s early monochrome works on paper, an aesthetic that sparked the interest of institutions such as M+ in Hong Kong. “I understand now that it was connected to my autism and the need for a calm environment,” added Anouk, who was diagnosed with the neurological and developmental disorder earlier this year. At Patricia Low Contemporary—the Gstaad-based gallery where Anouk’s solo exhibition “Lesbian Jazz: Meditating in the Alps” is on view through October 14th—Anouk spoke with Artsy about their art practice and gender fluidity. ⁠
