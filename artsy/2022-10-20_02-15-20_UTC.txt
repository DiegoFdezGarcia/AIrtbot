Throughout her expansive practice, Katharina Grosse frees abstract painting from the traditional confines of two-dimensional picture planes. The artist is best known for her large-scale in situ installations in which she sprays paint directly onto the surfaces of architecture, interiors, and landscapes—her vibrant hues become inseparable from the land, structures, and grit they cover. Grosse has also painted canvases while they hang on the wall, draped canvases from exhibition space ceilings, and created colorful forms that emerge from the floor, blurring the boundaries between painting and sculpture.⁠
