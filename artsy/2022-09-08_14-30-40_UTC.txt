The inaugural edition of Frieze Seoul, which ran at the Korean capital’s mega convention complex COEX from September 2nd through 5th, was not unlike other iterations of the global art fair. Lines extended outside the event starting on September 2nd’s VIP day, and selfies were captured at scene-stealing booths. It’s not so surprising that Frieze Seoul was met with over 70,000 visitors and substantial sales throughout more than 120 booths (including 18 focused on historic work in Frieze Masters).⁠
