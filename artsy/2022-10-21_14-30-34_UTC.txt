Carol Bove makes poetic, anthropological assemblages and spare sculptures that comment on social and political histories and narratives. Bove often compiles found materials—which include industrial steel, petrified wood, books, and detritus—into elegant, pared-down constructions. These pieces memorialize and comment on the specific eras that the materials hail from, demonstrating the interconnections of various objects throughout history. The artist’s monumental recent works resemble contorted, colored tubes and ducts. ⁠
