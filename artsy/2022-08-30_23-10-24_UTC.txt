David Montalba, the leader of the Lausanne- and Los Angeles–based Montalba Architects, is known for designing residential and hospitality spaces that harmoniously intertwine the clean precision of Swiss design with the airy lightness of California modernism. The firm, whose work and design philosophy is the subject of a new book, Place and Space, is often cited for realizing the beloved Nobu Ryokan in Malibu and The Row’s West Hollywood shop. A close third is Montalba’s own home. The Santa Monica residence, with its exceptional three-story “courtyard/atrium,” is typical of the Swiss American architect’s flair for integrating indoor and outdoor spaces. And notably, the home is ever so carefully dotted with works from the impressive art collection Montalba and his wife, Amy, share. There’s no denying that the architect’s practiced eye extends to art collecting.⁠
