Nokukhanya Langa’s latest show at Saatchi Yates (@saatchiyates) delves into the world of modern media and internet culture while breaking the rules of traditional painting. An exploration of figuration and abstraction, the exhibition features over 20 new paintings from Langa’s continued research into image and reality, using the Internet as a source of inspiration. Explore and inquire on works from the show on Artsy through the link in our bio until November 14th.⁠
