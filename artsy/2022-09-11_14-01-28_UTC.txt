Devin Troy Strother’s exuberant, darkly funny figurations comment on racial prejudice, performance, and kitsch. They draw on references that range from stand-up comedy and music to Henri Matisse’s cutouts and Joseph Cornell’s absurdist assemblages. The Los Angeles–based artist’s practice—which spans painting, printmaking, sculpture, mixed-media work, and installation—is united by humor and an engagement with contemporary issues. Strother gives his works sly titles, which both nod to his artistic predecessors and provide punch lines to his compositions’ visual humor.⁠
