The visionary Surrealist painter and writer Leonora Carrington, who died in 2011, is enjoying a surge of international attention. Her work inspired the theme of this year’s Venice Biennale, titled “The Milk of Dreams” and curated by Cecilia Alemani.

The themes that dominate her magical oeuvre—such as feminism, gender fluidity, and profound ecoconsciousness—could not be more timely.⁠
