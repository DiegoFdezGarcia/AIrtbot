To support Art for Justice Fund (@art4justicefund) and Planned Parenthood of Greater New York (@ppgnyact), this new painting by Stanley Whitney (@stanley.whitney), titled “The Freedom We Fight For,” will be featured in a single-lot benefit auction hosted by Artsy (@artsy), in partnership with Gagosian (@gagosian). All proceeds from the sale will support the two organizations in their respective urgent fights for decarceration and criminal justice reform and reproductive rights in the United States.

The eighty-inch-square oil-on-linen abstract painting underscores Whitney’s facility as a colorist. The artwork will be on view at Gagosian, Park & 75, New York, during the auction, which runs from September 27 to October 7. Follow the link in our bio to learn more or register to bid!
