Taking a particular interest in how new technologies influence our behavior, Coline Marotta’s gentle expressionistic paintings explore issues of communication, intimacy, and restlessness. Marotta draws on her own experiences as well as stories she has heard from friends or strangers in order to create her all-too-relatable narratives. She also creates line drawings in wax pastel on paper which—like her paintings—are full of sweetness yet underlined by melancholy. ⁠
