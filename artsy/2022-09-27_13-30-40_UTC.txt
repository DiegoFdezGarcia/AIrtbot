Night’s hallucinatory impact on memory is a sensation conjured in the neon-lit paintings of James Bartolacci. Despite the multitude of instances and sensations, Bartolacci translates onto canvas, he counts a singular night as a transformative moment. “I will always remember the final night that the Spectrum was opened before it closed down in January of 2019,” he recalled of Bushwick’s beloved yet short-lived queer club and art space. “To know this was the last time that my friends and I would dress up and spend the night dancing made me want to preserve it even more in my memory and practice. That night, in particular, the blaring music, strobe lights, and smoke machines seemed to completely engulf us—almost encapsulating the crowd in this joyous but bittersweet moment.”⁠
