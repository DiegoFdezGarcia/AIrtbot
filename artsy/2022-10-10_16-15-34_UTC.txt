With vibrant swirls of color and an eye towards West African aesthetics, Tunji Adeniyi-Jones paints Black bodies in repose and lush, mystical flora and fauna. The U.K.-born, New York–based artist draws on both his Yoruba heritage and diasporic experiences to inform his beguiling canvases, where he honors his ancestors’ ceremonies and celebrations. Adeniyi-Jones believes that his portrayals of the body can transcend linguistic barriers and present a common language of movement and intimacy.⁠
