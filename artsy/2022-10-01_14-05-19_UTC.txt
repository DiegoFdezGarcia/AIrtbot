An artist, designer, and columnist, Luke Edward Hall creates playful still lifes and portraits of young men surrounded by flowers using pastels, gouache, and watercolors. Deeply inspired by elements of fantasy, romanticism, and other aesthetic movements from European art history, Hall hints obliquely at narrative through his colorful works on paper.⁠
