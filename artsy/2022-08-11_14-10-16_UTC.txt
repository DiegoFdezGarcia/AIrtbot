Obsessed with celebrity, consumer culture, and mechanical reproduction, Andy Warhol created some of the 20th century’s most iconic images. Rejecting the dominant painting and sculpting modes of his day, Warhol embraced silk-screen printmaking to achieve his characteristic hard edges and flat areas of color. The artist mentored Keith Haring and Jean-Michel Basquiat and continues to influence contemporary art around the world: His provocative successors include Richard Prince, Takashi Murakami, and Jeff Koons.⁠
