Swiss artist Chrissy Angliker embraces the emotion-laden uncertainty of life in her paintings, which convey an attempt to recognize the harmony between discipline and disorder. Her works demonstrate a persistent common theme: figures or human bodies in bodies of water. Her artistic practice involves allowing unintentional marks and gestures to expand the work and enable the final result to unfold. Surrendering control to the painting’s nature allows the boundaries of the painting to broaden and give space to the viewer to understand and project their feelings.⁠
