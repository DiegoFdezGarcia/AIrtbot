An ice cream shop appears at the end of the road that leads to Annie Morris’s North London studio. In the summer, it attracts long lines of customers, who emerge holding cones teetering with brightly colored globes. Sooner or later, someone’s treat topples and falls: Contained in every moment of ecstasy is the potential for loss and despair. To make her vertiginous “Stack” sculptures, she carves crude spheres into foam, layers them with sand and plaster (and, more recently, bronze), and finally paints them in lucid colors. Morris then seamlessly “stacks” the balls at varying heights and joins them invisibly with steel. This final step creates the illusion of a balancing act, making her monumental structures appear as precarious as a pile of children’s building blocks.⁠
