Luc Tuymans’s muted, mysterious paintings transform source material from television, film, and photography into meditations on history, memory, and the mediation of images in contemporary culture. Tuymans recontextualizes his found images as he renders them in a blurred, anxious style and removes any clarifying narrative elements; with soft palettes of grays and browns, he narrows in on haunting details and their emotional undertones.⁠
