In her imaginative large-scale paintings, Sophie von Hellermann depicts imagery from fables, mythology, literature, and current events that she imbues with subconscious associations. Von Hellermann’s lush, gestural paintings—whose lyrical compositions express intense emotional and psychological content—are informed by German Expressionism. She smears pastel-hued paints directly onto wet, unprimed canvases using a broad brush to create a soft, romantic effect. All rendered in the same loose, painterly style, figures, and their surroundings dissolve into each other, blurring the boundaries between subjects and space.⁠
