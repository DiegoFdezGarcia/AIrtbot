This week, the 1-54 Contemporary African Art Fair celebrates the 10th anniversary of its London edition. Touria El Glaoui founded the fair in 2013, aiming to share her love for Africa’s bustling cultural scene with a broader public. Her own trajectory mirrors that of 1-54: gradually establishing connections around the world, figuring out year by year how to better aid artists and galleries across the continent. El Glaoui was born in Casablanca, Morocco, and she brings a unique cultural and occupational background to her position as the fair’s director. ⁠
