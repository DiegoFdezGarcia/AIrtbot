Richard Learoyd's latest show at Fraenkel Gallery (@fraenkelgallery) marks a deepening of the artist's exploration of classical themes, using exacting techniques to create pictorially lush photographs. The exhibition features nudes, still lifes, and portraits made over the last three years using the artist’s room-sized camera obscura in London. Collect works from the show on Artsy through the link in our bio until December 23rd.⁠
