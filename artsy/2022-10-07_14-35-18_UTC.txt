Marcel Dzama draws from folk vernacular, Surrealist film, Dada whimsy, and Soviet agitprop to create lush, dreamlike works on paper. Dzama’s primary media include watercolor, ink, and graphite, and his otherworldly figures and settings can evoke fairy tales, alternate histories, and religious iconography.⁠
