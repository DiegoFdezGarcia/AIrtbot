Artsy contributing writer Mieke Marple (@miekemarple) writes, "My love affair with NFTs began at the same time I was reading linguist Amanda Montell’s 'Cultish: The Language of Fantatism'. Her book talks about how words, especially neologisms, can be used towards cultish ends: At best, they can foster community; at worst, they can be used to brainwash. 'Oh my god,' I thought, seeing the barrage of NFT acronyms (LFG, WAGMI, GM) and context-specific phrases (degen, probably nothing, diamond hands) on my Twitter feed. 'Am I in a cult?' At the link in our bio, Marple shares NFT market terms that are more solid and less trendy than the aforementioned Twitter slang. They will serve any collector well as they explore the dynamic—and, yes, sometimes cultish—world of NFTs.⁠
