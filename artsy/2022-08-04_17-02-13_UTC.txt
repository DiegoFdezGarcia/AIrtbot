🏀 Just dropped: "Hoop Dreams” (2022) by Mikey Yates. Belonging and emotional connection are central themes in Filipino-American painter Mikey Yates’s work. The artist spent his childhood frequently relocating due to his parents’ military careers, but one constant was basketball. Yates offers us a candid glimpse of his bedroom, where the adolescent artist reclines on his bedroom and idly tosses and catches a ball in the air, dreaming of one day playing in the NBA. On the wall behind we see a carefully arranged display of tear-sheet posters from Slam magazine. A ray of light streaks across the textured wall, illuminating basketball legends frozen mid-action in their moments of glory. Yates welcomes us to reflect on the impact that the people and places have on us, and what is really means to feel at home. “I am interested in the stories places tell about people, and the stories people tell about places,” the artist has said.⁠
