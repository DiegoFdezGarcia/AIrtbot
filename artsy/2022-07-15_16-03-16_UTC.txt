Impact: LA for Choice 2022 is a contemporary art auction benefiting W.R.R.A.P. (Women’s Reproductive Rights Assistance Project). Co-hosted by Anat Ebgi Gallery (@anatebgigallery) and Artsy, 100% of proceeds from this initiative will be donated to W.R.R.A.P. as a visual protest by 40+ LA artists in solidarity with reproductive rights. W.R.R.A.P. (@wrrapreprojustice) is the largest national, independent, nonprofit abortion fund. They provide urgently-needed financial assistance nationwide to individuals seeking abortion services or emergency contraception. W.R.R.A.P. ensures that financially-disadvantaged individuals of all ages, ethnicities, cultural backgrounds, gender identities, and sexual orientations can access abortion care and emergency contraception. Bidding is now open on Artsy, closing July 29th.⁠
