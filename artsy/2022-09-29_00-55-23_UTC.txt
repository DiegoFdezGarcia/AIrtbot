Stanley Whitney’s new painting "The Freedom We Fight For" (2022) is the focus of a new Artsy Spotlight Auction, in partnership with Gagosian, to benefit the Art for Justice Fund and Planned Parenthood of Greater New York. The striking, 80-square-inch painting is rendered in Whitney’s signature color-block style, featuring hues of red, yellow, green, orange, brown, black, and gray divided by horizontal lines of red, blue, and teal. The work is emblematic of the modernist grid, though at the same time, it deconstructs that historical form through its immersive use of color.⁠
