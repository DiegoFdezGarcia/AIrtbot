The latest show at Buchmann Galerie (@buchmann_galerie) explores the British-American artist William Tucker’s preoccupation with the subject of the head in sculpture, oscillating between portrait and mask, between bust and form. Titled “Portraits and Masks,” the two-part exhibition explores the artist’s bronze busts alongside his “Imaginary Portraits” series from the late ‘90s. Explore and inquire on works from the show on Artsy through the link in our bio until October 29th.⁠
