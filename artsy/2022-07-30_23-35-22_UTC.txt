Multidisciplinary artist Derrick Adams is a master practitioner of the Ubuntu philosophy. An ideology woven all throughout the African continent, Ubuntu most commonly translates to “I am because we are.” A person who embodies Ubuntu, as Adams does, is influenced, if not defined by, the greater collective. Adams’s latest community-focused endeavor is a collaboration with Tiffany & Co. The iconic jewelry brand invited Adams to participate in its new social-impact platform Atrium. His new work "I Shine, You Shine, We Shine" (2022) is inset into the Atrium logo and will be sold in a benefit auction in partnership with Tiffany & Co., which takes place on Artsy from July 27th through August 10th. One hundred percent of proceeds from the sale will go to Adams’s artist residency program, The Last Resort Artist Retreat. In the thick of ubiquitous uncertainty, chaos, and loss, Adams reminds us, “the piece represents our never-ending pursuit of love and the hope of shared compassion for one another.”⁠
