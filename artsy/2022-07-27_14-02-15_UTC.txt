In partnership with Tiffany & Co., Artsy is honored to auction “I Shine, You Shine, We Shine⁠,” a single artwork by Derrick Adams with 100% of proceeds benefiting The Last Resort Artist Retreat, the artist residency founded by Adams in his hometown of Baltimore. According to Adams, “the piece represents our never-ending pursuit of love, and the hope of shared compassion for one another. This artwork incorporates sections of clothing patterns as a stand-in for the figure and a bisected heart motif is repeated throughout as a symbol of openness and sharing. Additionally, the floral patterns envision what growth looks like when we come together to embrace diversity as our superpower.” Bidding is open exclusively on Artsy through Wednesday, August 10th through the link in our bio.⁠
