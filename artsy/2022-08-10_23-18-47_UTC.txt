“Vibrant Matters” at Jeffrey Deitch Gallery, curated by Melanie Kress, features new works by the 2022 Yale School of Art Painting & Printmaking MFA Graduates. MFA shows have long been fertile ground for collectors looking to discover a fresh crop of artistic talent from around the globe. In addition to being great places to acquire major statement pieces at accessible prices, graduate exhibitions also give collectors an opportunity to directly connect with and support the next generation of artists.
