Omar Bar’s latest show at Templon (@galerietemplon) features elaborate canvases populated with chimeras and unexpected hybridizations between real and imaginary worlds. Titled “Droit du Sol - Droit de Rêver,” the exhibition combines cultural references, nods to art history, and a fascination with current events. Collect works from the show on Artsy through the link in our bio.
