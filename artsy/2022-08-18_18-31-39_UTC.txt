The masterful abstraction of artists Norman Bluhm and Esteban Vicente takes the spotlight in a pair of shows at Miles McEnery Gallery (miles.mcenery.gallery) in New York. Norman Bluhm’s post-Abstract-Expressionist paintings from the 1970s are rich with movement, while Esteban Vicenta’s Abstract Expressionist works demonstrate the salutary effects of abstract painting.
