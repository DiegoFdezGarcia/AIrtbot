Coinciding with Frieze London, Unit London (@unitlondon) presents an international group exhibition curated by the artist Helen Beard and art historians Alayo Akinkugbe and Maria Elena Buszek. Titled “Sensitive Content,” the exhibition seeks to uncover ways in which social media content restrictions are contributing to a sanitized art culture, but also the courageous and creative methods by which artists are pushing back. Explore and inquire on works from the show on Artsy through the link in our bio until October 16th.⁠
