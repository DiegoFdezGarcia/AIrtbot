Petra Cortright uses a range of digital and analog media to explore the aesthetics of online consumption and performance. Cortright makes digital paintings by using Photoshop to manipulate, distort, and “paint” over imagery that she harvests online. She then prints the final works—which range from figuration to pure abstraction—onto aluminum sheets.⁠
