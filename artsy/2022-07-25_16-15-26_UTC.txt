Kevin Darmanie utilizes photographs of himself and his friends to create his portraiture, referencing elements of his own life and shared experiences to inform clean narrative works which explore complex relationships between image, object, gaze, and landscape. The artist’s sense of color, line, and composition simultaneously evokes the loose, illustrative style of 1980’s European graphic novels and the chaotic aesthetic of 20th Century metaphysical painting. Within his depictions of cellphone-photographed scenes of people in intimate, cluttered spaces, this stylistic combination serves to convey an intersection of ages. Modernity melds with the past.⁠
