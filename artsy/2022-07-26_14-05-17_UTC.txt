Zadie Xa’s works span electric pink varsity jackets, embroidered tapestries edged with fringe, small figurative sculptures, and spirited performances. They bring together personal narratives and fantasy, with hints of both the ’90s and Korean traditions. Identity is a driving force across her practice, inspired by her place among the Korean diaspora, and a commitment to representing people of color.⁠
