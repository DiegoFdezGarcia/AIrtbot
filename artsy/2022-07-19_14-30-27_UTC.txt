Hayv Kahraman’s oil-on-linen paintings depict women in both peaceful repose, and unsettling contortions. Embracing material exploration, the Iraqi-born artist has sliced into her canvases, incorporated acoustic foam amid the linen, painted on wood, made sculptures, sketched, and choreographed performances. Kahraman draws on disparate influences including Renaissance painting, Persian miniature painting, Art Nouveau, and her own experience as a woman in the Iraqi diaspora.⁠
