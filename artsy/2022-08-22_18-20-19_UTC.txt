Painter Cecily Brown works at the intersection of figuration and abstraction: She fills her monumental canvases with intimations of body parts and virtuosic, gestural brushstrokes that resolve more or less clearly into art history–inspired scenes. Brown draws on a range of compositional tenets including the formal planes of Neoclassicism, the vigor of Abstract Expressionists such as Willem de Kooning, and the haunting, fractured forms of Francis Bacon. Her paintings become intense, kaleidoscopic evocations of atmosphere and bodily experience.⁠
