The psychological descriptions expressed in the faces of Yoshino Hirota's subjects are contemporaneous and realistic. Hirota's work does not have an optimistic viewpoint. The work expresses, in a vague but fresh way, the sense of reality and worldview held by individuals living in an age when the way of looking at things and thinking, which were once thought to be certain and on which we should live our lives, is no longer certain.⁠
