Timothy Lai’s colorful, fluid figurative paintings use the language of art history and myth to explore his biracial identity. Born in Malaysia to a Mexican American mother and a father of Chinese heritage, Lai turned from abstraction to figuration during graduate studies in painting at the Rhode Island School of Design, where he earned his MFA in 2017. Based on scenarios from his own life, including navigating interracial relationships, Lai’s paintings feature characteristically contorted figures.⁠
