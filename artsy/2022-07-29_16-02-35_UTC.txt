Curated by Brooke Wise (@wisebrooke), “Thine Face Is Not Worth Sunburning” is a collection of works whose subject matter plays with sarcasm or humor as a means of coping. Satire, absurdity, and humor—both intentional and unintentional—have been used as vehicles to cope with our day-to-day realities ever since humans started making art. Wise's selection of works may first appear playful, but also pointedly address the political and social issues of our time Discover the collection—whose title references an amusing and memorable insult from Shakespeare’s 1599 play, "Henry V"—on Artsy through the link in our bio.⁠
