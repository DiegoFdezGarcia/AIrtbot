🎵 Artsy Mixtape 026 just dropped on Spotify, curated by conceptual artist Hank Willis Thomas (@hankwillisthomas) in collaboration with artists Zoë Buckman, Pamela Council, Carly Fisher, Eric Gottesman, Jun Mabuchi, Muna Malik, Joiri Minaya, and Kambui Olujimi. Together, these artists are featured in the group show “Another Justice: US Is Them,” which opened at Parrish Art Museum on July 24th. “It’s a call to the community to reconvene and reconsider what justice can be in a time of imbalance,” Willis Thomas said. “The road to progress is always under construction, rife with bumps, potholes, and hazards. In spite of—and because of—our collective and individual trauma, we invite you to vividly imagine what a just world would and could look like.” From Beyonce to Nina Simone, drop into Spotify to hear the songs that have inspired the show through the link in our bio.⁠
