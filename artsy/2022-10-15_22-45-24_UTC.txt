This year, Frieze returns to Regent’s Park in London, gathering more than 280 galleries from 42 countries in a kaleidoscopic collection of classical and contemporary art. Amid economic turmoil on U.K. soil, geopolitical uncertainty across the continent, and mourning for a monarch who represented stability and British identity for many, the bustling booths at Frieze offer escapism and hope—sites for collectors and visitors to find inspiration during tumultuous times.⁠
