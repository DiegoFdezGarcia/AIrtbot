Birthed from equal parts make-believe and daily ritual, Seyni Awa Camara’s majestic humanoid clay sculptures evoke mythological deities and are derived from her encounters with the folk gods of Senegal’s Wolof people. Born around 1945 in Bignona, Senegal, the Diola artist has been making work for the past five decades and receiving increased institutional recognition throughout Europe and Africa in the last twenty years. A selection of Camara’s mythical sculptures that were made between 1983 and 2019 are currently on view in London through October 30th in “Amongst the Living with Seyni Awa Camara,” White Cube’s two-person exhibition with painter Michael Armitage. Described as “truth revealers” by Camara’s longtime gallerist André Magnin of Magnin-A, the sculptures participate in the ever-expanding mythos of Camara’s journey to becoming an artist, making her the lead architect of her own narrative.⁠
