During a 1986 interview with scholar and artist Coco Fusco, legendary Black British artist-filmmaker Judah (née Martina) Attille stated that British arts and media is informed by Eurocentric ideas that negate and belittle its own role in colonization. In particular, she drew attention to the dry, mainstream politics that Black British artists are expected to internalize and reproduce across their work—thus leaving Black art and film to resolve and redress numerous falsehoods about their histories and lived experiences, which, critically, leaves no room for pleasure. New generations of artists are creating enriching political arguments to change notions of empire and British colonialism while integrating self-expression. In honor of Black History Month in the U.K., Artsy is partnering with Art for Black Lives to offer a collection of limited-edition prints by eight of these artists. All proceeds from the sale, which continues through December 7th, will go towards Black Trans Alliance—a Black-, queer-, and trans-led nonprofit organization that protects and amplifies the voices of Black trans folks in London and beyond.⁠
