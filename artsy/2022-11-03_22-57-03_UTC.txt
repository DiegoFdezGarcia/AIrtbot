Jinbin Chen's latest show at Kohn Gallery (@kohngallery) features masculine bodies traversing a terrain of liminal gender dispositions, examining themes of family and intimacy through subjects rooted in anonymity. The Oslo-based artist utilizes soft color to blend and romanticize the gap between the ideal and the past. Collect works from "Returnees" on Artsy through the link in our bio until January 14th.⁠
