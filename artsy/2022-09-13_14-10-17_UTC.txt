In his drawings, installations, videos, and sculptures, artist and musician Brian DeGraw intersects art and music. He draws subject matter for his work from his encounters in New York’s experimental music scene—as a popular DJ and a keyboardist for the band Gang Gang Dance. Not dissimilar to Christian Marclay, DeGraw’s experiences in one discipline inform his production in the other.⁠
